## Editions

### Differences between editions

MyCollab offers several choices for potential and existing customers. You are free to select the best solution that fits your business needs. Basically, MyCollab presents you with three choices of usage:

#### Community Edition

Being an open source of MyCollab with GPL v3 license, the Community Edition contains basic features necessary for freelancers or small companies that have basic needs for collaboration, customer management, etc. MyCollab's source codes are bundled in delivery and you can customize things in any way you want as long as the terms and conditions of GPL v3 license are retained.

#### Premium Edition

This edition incorporate Community Edition with several extra closed source of MyCollab modules to help the system run faster, having more features. This edition is the right fit for medium-sized company that needs advanced features of project management, customer management and more. We also provide technical support, bug fixes and free upgrades within 1 year.

#### On-demand Edition

This edition does not require you to undertake any technical tasks such as installation, configuration, etc. but to register an account and invite your team members. This edition is updated by MyCollab team every two weeks for continuously added features, bug fixing, backup safe database and improved documentation. It is also the most economical solution compared with those above editions.

### Which version should I choose?

#### Community Edition

It is usually used within academic environments and non-critical implementations. It is supported only through the forum, which may not provide Official Support on MyCollab's Team behalf. It is not recommended for business environments because it may contain bugs provided with neither support nor resolution time guarantee, which can at times be essential.

#### Premium Edition

It has all of the features the Community Edition does, not to mention many more as compared above. This edition is recommended if you cannot use our on-demand service due to organization policy or law requisite.
Note: Please bear in mind that there are actually more differences, but not all of them have been addressed except for the main ones.

#### On-demand Edition

We ensure immediate support on any issue, access to MyCollab development team, new features and versions, as well as advice to get the most out of MyCollab and recommendations to avoid common problems.

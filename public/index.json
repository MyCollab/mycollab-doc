But, we try to write the good code, and we found that Kotlin helps us to write cleaner code, less error prone. However, it is difficult to write entire existing codebase in Kotlin. There are tips that many back-end codes are written by Kotlin.\nBelow are the main frameworks, libraries are used in MyCollab.\nSpring boot MyCollab uses the micro service architecture, although you can see see it in the community codebase. We use Spring boot 2 to manage all services in MyCollab from both front-end, back-end.\nMybatis Mybatis is the persistence framework to interact with MySQL. We use MyBatis customize SQL alot to provide the dynamic query SQL, complex SQL execution.\nVaadin Vaadin is an UI framework for the MyCollab front-end. At this moment, we are using the Vaadin 8.\nGuava Guava is used extensively in MyCollab as the complementary APIs for the lacking support from the standard Java API.

This edition is updated by MyCollab team every two weeks for continuously added features, bug fixing, backup safe database and improved documentation. It is also the most economical solution compared with those above editions.\nWhich version should I choose? Community Edition It is usually used within academic environments and non-critical implementations. It is supported only through the forum, which may not provide Official Support on MyCollab\u0026rsquo;s Team behalf. It is not recommended for business environments because it may contain bugs provided with neither support nor resolution time guarantee, which can at times be essential.\nPremium Edition It has all of the features the Community Edition does, not to mention many more as compared above. This edition is recommended if you cannot use our on-demand service due to organization policy or law requisite. Note: Please bear in mind that there are actually more differences, but not all of them have been addressed except for the main ones.\nOn-demand Edition We ensure immediate support on any issue, access to MyCollab development team, new features and versions, as well as advice to get the most out of MyCollab and recommendations to avoid common problems.
